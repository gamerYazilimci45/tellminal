# tellminal
Send message from terminal :computer:ðŸ”®

# How This Work?
It requires two devices to operate. One must be started as `server` and one as `client`. First `client` sends messages to `server`, then `server` sends messages to `client` and so on. tellminal does all this using Python and Socket.

# Installation
- Download `installer.sh`
- Run it
- `tellminal` is succesfully installed!
